I wanted to stress...the white race is not a anthropological phenomenon...it is a social phenomenon, a historical phenomenon. And I wanted to indicate further...it did not just happen, but it was deliberately formed. And that's why I use the term invention.

Revealing the African Presence in Renaissance Europe  

Published on Oct 29, 2013  

Revealing the African Presence in Renaissance Europe invites visitors to explore the roles of Africans and their descendants in Renaissance Europe as revealed in compelling paintings, drawings, sculpture and printed books of the period. Vivid portraits from life both encourage face-to-face encounters with the individuals themselves and pose questions about the challenges of color, class, and stereotypes that this new diversity brought to Europe. Despite the importance of the questions posed for audiences today, this is the first time they have been addressed in a major exhibition. Organized by the Walters, the exhibition opened in Baltimore on October 14 and at the Princeton University Art Museum in February 2013. It featured about 75 works of art drawn from the Walters, major museums in the U.S. and Europe, and private collections.

Cranach's Saint Maurice 

At The Met Fifth Avenue

APRIL 20–JULY 27, 2015
 
Since its arrival at the Metropolitan Museum in 2005, Cranach's Saint Maurice has re-emerged from relative obscurity. While the image itself has reappeared from beneath deposits of accumulated grime and dark varnish following its conservation treatment, technical and art historical research have yielded new information about the historical context of this first black saint and the attribution of the work.

This focused exhibition explores the painting and its fascinating history in depth. It also features related objects from the Museum's collection, including paintings, reliquaries, armor, prints, and medals.

The exhibition is made possible by Northern Trust.

The publication is made possible by the Drue E. Heinz Fund.

The Metropolitan's quarterly Bulletin program is supported in part by the Lila Acheson Wallace Fund for The Metropolitan Museum of Art, established by the cofounder of Reader's Digest.

[Intro]
No, this is not a Hollywood blockbuster
Planes crashing into these towers are real
And these buildings crash to the ground
Including one that wasn't hit by anything at all
The American population was terrorized, hypnotized, and traumatized
By repetitive showings of the devastation
With the media repeating, over and over
That it was a terrorist attack
Yeah-yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
My confidence is up, I believe with all my soul
I could do anything that I put my heart into
I spend all of my time focused in the lab
Comin' up with these songs, masterin' my craft
'Cause I'ma need that boat or one of them aircrafts
God gave me a life and I'ma live this shit
So, wassup? Don't get your head bust up
You're in my way, young brother
Get out my way, young brother
Or I'ma run you down
You should have accepted my offer
Brush me off like it's nothin'
I understand, no it's okay
Run along now, you interrupting
The illest rapper still active
Move dope, then all of my past shit
I was just a boy, I was only 19
But by mind be on some old lex shit

[Hook]
Race don't matter
Your faith don't matter
The enemy is government tyranny
All that other shit don't matter

[Verse 2]
My confidence like armor
I know with all my being
That I could do anything
I just work hard and I achieve it
Now watch me create money
For the next 300 years
So my great grandkids'll eat food
Off of these words I'm saying here
Yeah, I wrote this with you in mind
I'm so far ahead of my time
My body will never catch up to where my brain is at
Sometime I gotta slow down and pace myself
I'm going too much over y'all head
My school of thought like the Essenes
And some secrets are best kept sacred
It's one big religious war with these old books
Who's wrong or right, who cares?
Wake up, they diverting our attention
From what's really going on right here, right now
Toxic food, it's causing cancer, you don't have to smoke
Toxic politicians, the system is rigged but go 'head and vote

[Hook]
Race don't matter
Your faith don't matter
The enemy is government tyranny
All that other shit don't matter
You rich, don't matter
You broke, don't matter
The enemy, they threaten our liberties
All that other shit don't matter

[Outro]
This time, vote like your whole world depended on it
